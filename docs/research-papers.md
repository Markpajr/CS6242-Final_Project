[Fueyo, N., Sanz, Y., Rodrigues, M., Montañés, C. and Dopazo, C. (2010), High resolution modelling of the on-shore technical wind energy potential in Spain. Wind Energ., 13: 717-726. https://doi.org/10.1002/we.392](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/we.392)

Talks about calculating the method for the wind energy potential in Spain.

[Where, when and how much wind is available? A provincial-scale wind resource assessment for China](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421514004078)

Provides a formula for coming up with Wind Energy potential by using wind speed, slope factor and bathymetry(???).

[Schwartz, M, George, R, and Elliott, D. The Use of Reanalysis Data for Wind Resource Assessment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. United States: N. p., 1999. Web.](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/7074)

Talks about NREL's efforts to do wind energy potential analysis. Everything talks about using models and GIS data, but I haven't found the models or the underlying data yet.

[C. McKeown, A. Adelaja, B. Calnin
On developing a prospecting tool for wind industry and policy decision support
Energ Policy, 39 (2) (2011), pp. 905-915](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510008396#bib9)

Provides useful list and framework for availability potential for wind energy.
